Creating a workflow diagram for the ride and driver logic involves outlining the key processes and interactions between the user, driver, and the system. Below is a textual representation of the workflow, which you can use to create a visual diagram using tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or any diagramming software.

# Workflow Diagram: Ride and Driver Logic

## Workflow Steps

1. **User Initiates Ride Request**
   - User opens the app.
   - User selects "Request Ride."

2. **System Checks Driver Availability**
   - System checks for available drivers in the vicinity.
   - If no drivers are available:
     - Notify user: "No drivers available."
   - If drivers are available:
     - Proceed to the next step.

3. **Driver Receives Ride Request**
   - System sends ride request to available drivers.
   - Drivers receive notification of the ride request.

4. **Driver Accepts Ride Request**
   - Driver reviews ride details (pickup location, destination).
   - Driver accepts or declines the ride.
   - If declined:
     - Notify user: "Driver declined the ride."
     - Return to step 2.
   - If accepted:
     - Proceed to the next step.

5. **User is Notified of Driver Acceptance**
   - User receives notification with driver details (name, vehicle, estimated arrival time).

6. **Driver Navigates to Pickup Location**
   - Driver uses navigation to reach the pickup location.
   - User can track driverâ€™s location in real-time.

7. **User Gets Picked Up**
   - Driver arrives at the pickup location.
   - User gets in the vehicle.

8. **Ride in Progress**
   - Driver navigates to the destination.
   - User can see ride progress and estimated time of arrival.

9. **User Completes Ride**
   - User arrives at the destination.
   - User can rate the driver and provide feedback.

10. **Payment Process**
    - System processes payment.
    - User receives receipt for the ride.

11. **Driver Updates Status**
    - Driver marks the ride as complete.
    - Driver can see earnings and ride history.

## Diagram Elements

- **Actors**: User, Driver, System
- **Processes**: Request Ride, Check Availability, Accept/Decline Ride, Notify User, Navigate, Complete Ride, Process Payment
- **Decision Points**: Availability of drivers, Acceptance of ride request

## Visual Representation

You can represent this workflow in a flowchart format with the following elements:
- **Start/End**: Represented by ovals.
- **Processes**: Represented by rectangles.
- **Decision Points**: Represented by diamonds.
- **Arrows**: Indicate the flow of the process.
